Question: ${question}

Retrieved Context (raw JSON from memory provider):
${contextStr}

Instructions:
- The context above is the raw JSON response from a memory search API
- Extract relevant information from the JSON to answer the question
- Consider any temporal/date information present in the data
- If the context contains enough information, provide a clear, concise answer
- If the context does not contain enough information, respond with "I don't know"
- Base your answer ONLY on the provided context

/** Semantic equivalence rules to reduce judge flip-flops on paraphrases. */
const JUDGE_EQUIVALENCE_RUBRIC = `
Equivalence rules (apply before scoring):
- Treat related academic/career fields as overlapping when the ground truth lists multiple fields (e.g. "Psychology, counseling certification" matches answers that name counseling, mental health, therapy, or psychology without requiring every exact word).
- Broader domain terms may satisfy narrower ground truth when clearly implied (e.g. "mental health" can satisfy "psychology" in an education/career context).
- Minor spelling differences, punctuation, or ordering do not matter.
- Be consistent: if two answers convey the same factual content, score them the same.`

If the response only contains a subset of the information required by the answer, answer no.

export const ABSTENTION_JUDGE_PROMPT = `You are evaluating an abstention question. The correct answer is that the information was NOT in the conversation, so the system should abstain or say it doesn't know.

The hypothesis is CORRECT if the system correctly abstains, says "I don't know", indicates uncertainty, or explicitly states the information is not available. It is INCORRECT if the system makes up an answer or hallucinates.

If the response only contains a subset of the information required by the answer, answer no. In addition, do not penalize off-by-one errors for the number of days. If the question asks for the number of days/weeks/months, etc., and the model makes off-by-one errors (e.g., predicting 19 days when the answer is 18), the model's response is still correct.
